BIG SCREEN - test
=============

This is an old funny experiment.
I was fighting to make fit my UI to across multiple devices with important screen differences.
I create this rule that can be integrated with Modernizr for detect big screen


My first test :

Device | Screen width | Results
:-- | :--: | --:
s4 mini | 980px x 1544px  | to retest
Iphone 5C | 980px x 1409px  | to retest
Ipad mini | 980px x 1185px  | to retest
IPHONE 4 | 980px x 1140px | to retest
LG G3 | 980px x 1430px |  to retest
